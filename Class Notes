The internet works through an incredible large cable which 
runs along the sea floor connecting the world's countries together.

there are two types of computers within the internet stream.

server which works 24/7. this holds the websites and things like this.
consider it like a library

client computers which could be phones, desktops and laptops


client wants to access google. Our request is followed to the isp. they connect us to the internet
cable. They send the request to their dns server. This is a computer phone book. It has the location
of all the sites and things on the internet. this is saved as IP. the dns server gives this to the 
isp. they then use the ip to find the server and the content the user wanted. retrieves it and 
gifts it to the user to then see and use it.

star-link it is space version which will be wireless. Tesla is doing this.

a client would be more like the browser trying to access various sites or the video game trying to connect to the
server for multiplayer

API specifically Web API's. Has a brower as a client sending requests to the isp and servers to get responses and
present the content.

json is used with multiple code types e.g. js and python. They have their own methods for reading it. This is why the json within the code type is a string. 
json.parce() is used for this conversion.

xml is extensible markup language. Essentially the same thing
as json however it isn't used much anymore due to json becoming
the industry standard for its ease of use

json viewer for chrome extension is handy to see json within~
